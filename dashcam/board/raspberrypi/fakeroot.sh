# things up when:
# - we're using usbmount
# - you boot with a USB storage drive already connected
# Yeah, wtf?  usbmount creates a /var/run/usbmount directory when it detects
# a USB drive.  I think this may be happening before we run the init script to do
# the overlay filesystem and is screwing up /var so that other processes like RAUC can't
# write their data, which causes the RAUC daemon to not start.  Sigh, it's just
# one workaround after another...
